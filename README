### Getting Started

1) Visit the Google documentation to setup Unity with ARCore:
[https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/getting-started](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/getting-started)

2) The `third_party` library should be sim-linked to your Assets folder. If this doesn't work on your system, just drag the folder over.

This is not an official Google product.
